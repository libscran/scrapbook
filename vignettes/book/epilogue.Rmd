Here's a few more pieces of opinionated advice, drawn from bitter experience^[
Or as I often told my manager, "fools learn from experience, wise men learn from history."
In the end, I guess it didn't really matter as we both got fired.]:

- Don't feel too bad about making subjective decisions in the choice of parameters or analysis.
  Much of scRNA-seq data analysis is exploratory, which is inherently guided by our own interests.
  We're just generating new hypotheses at this point so we don't need to be too rigorous. 
- Because exploration is so open-ended, scRNA-seq data analysis can be quite time-consuming.
  You might want to repeat the analysis with different parameters, perform subclustering, etc. to examine the data from a different perspective.
  Make sure you get appropriate recognition for your effort^[
  For a study with a major single-cell component, a joint first/corresponding authorship seems to be fair market price for the primary analyst.].
- Always validate conclusions with independent replicates and a different (i.e., non-sequencing-based) assay technique. 
  We had a fun time with all the subjective data exploration to generate new hypotheses, but at some point, we need to pay the piper and test all the stuff we made up.

With some luck and effort, you might be able to use scRNA-seq to do some solid science. 
Just have fun out there, and if you're ever struggling with a project, just remember: it could be worse^[
A benefit of working in a corporate environment is that it really broadens your horizons.].
